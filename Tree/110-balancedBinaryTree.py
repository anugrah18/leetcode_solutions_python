# Solution class to determine if a binary tree is height-balanced
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root) -> bool:

            # Return whether the tree rooted at 'root' is balanced and its height

# Example usage:

# Construct the binary tree:
#        3
#       / \
#      9  20
#         / \
#        15  7

root = TreeNode(3)  # Root node with value 3
root.left = TreeNode(9)  # Left child of root with value 9
root.right = TreeNode(20)  # Right child of root with value 20
root.right.left = TreeNode(15)  # Left child of node 20 with value 15
root.right.right = TreeNode(7)  # Right child of node 20 with value 7

# Instantiate the Solution class and check if the binary tree is balanced
X = Solution()
print(X.isBalanced(root))  # Output True if the tree is balanced, otherwise False

# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree (each node is visited once)
# Space Complexity: O(N), due to the recursion stack in a skewed tree scenario
